In this section, six unsupervised learning algorithms are implemented and tested, which are K-means clustering, Expectation Maximization (Gaussian Mixture Models), Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, Random Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis.
I ran the clustering algorithms on the 2 datasets and the results are discussed. Dimensionality reduction algorithms applied on the 2 datasets and the results are discussed. I ran the clustering algorithms again but on the data after the dimensionality reduction algorithms applied to it.
Many other experiments and analysis are implemented and discussed in this project and can be found in the Analysis.pdf file.

Analysis.pdf file is a MUST read because it explains alot of information for these experiments.

All the codes are in IPYNB format, so you will need Jupyter Notebook to run my codes.

You will need to change the address for the data files directory in the code to the address where you save the data files.
