In this project, five supervised learning algorithms are implemented and tested on 2 different datasets. The training and testing error rates I obtained running the various learning algorithms on the datasets, I included graphs that show performance on both training and test data as a function of training size.
Many questions are answered in this project, such as why I did get such results? Comparison between the different algorithms. What parameters can be tuned to improve the performance?

Analysis.pdf file answers the above questions

All the codes are in IPYNB format, so you will need Jupyter Notebook to run my codes.

You will need to change the address for the data files directory in the code to the address where you save the data files.

The Digit Recognizer dataset is heavy dataset(42000 samples), it might take long time to process the data and get the results depends on how fast is your machine.
